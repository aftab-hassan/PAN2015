""painters produced their most highly valued work when they were 41.92 years old"" http://t.co/T8Gvom70GE  So... I've 15 years left for mine?		 @username your new discussion layout is confusing regarding who says what  because the comments aren't sectioned off. http://t.co/Dfkg4js2o2		 I never really understood why game environments (which you see most of) get so few resources compared to characters. https://t.co/3Af3fn7XVe		 @username 20k and 2048Â² on a gun  fine. But throwing the same on an enemy that you try to shoot before he gets too close?		 @username Guns using the texture already in memory is good. Guns on the floor having the same model as FPS isn't. Probably LOD models.		 @username I'm talking about chars that are small scale compared to enviro props. Extreme example: http://t.co/HOR8W8T2Pr 30~40tri scene		 @username Dammit Crendor. You broke Jesse's game and made the audio go *poof*. Totally your fault.		 @username @username I liken Esther to a movie. You can choose to progress or not  but not affect much else.

Just played the first two episodes of Quake again  game's still tight. Loving the smooth movement.		 So apparently paying â‚¬5 a month for Spotify makes me worse than a music pirate...? Dafuq? http://t.co/eP8m6V18Om		 @username Wanted to say I appreciate the choice for minions. Should make the game feel nicely crowded  and give 'bad' players more fun.		 @username Heh. I think it's funny you're apologizing for sound quality that's still better than  say  90% of youtube game voiceovers.		 I know this is cool and serious science  but it had me giggling like a kid.

That shit's golden  Telltale! http://t.co/Bs3VwRCRzd		 @username Are you still looking for people? I can free up some time and be (almost) completely dedicated the next month(s).		 @username I threw up some isometric examples at https://t.co/eBHrIdFtBJ (assuming you want to stick with the RPGmaker perspective)		 @username Not many developers/companies would opt out of lots of money because something's addictive. I respect you for that.		 Now that's a proper free to play Dungeon Keeper!		 http://t.co/Am1vJnMrjr I like this.		 @username @username  How do they not help? I find it very useful to know if a game has been designed for touchscreen  controller or KBM.		 @username Remember that fake Twitch-LoL video from this afternoon? Here's a REAL Twitch-Plays-Dota channel: http://t.co/LQdUtiWq2x		 @username Thanks for reminding me/us to disable adblock for places I regularly visit. Because it's often a fairer trade that TV/radio.		 Mini Metro http://t.co/XYeHJ47bGm Quite a novel idea: build your own growing metro system. Not sure about longevity/replayability  though.		 @username How about keeping the same root word and call them BullVids?		 @username Coil  because of its several experiments. Mirror's Edge  because of its absence. And whichever game started radial menus. Crysis?		 @username Consider that a free game thrown in by the gods  for your generous purchases.		 @username ""Luft"" means air  not red. And ""rauser"" probably stems from the Dutch verb ""rouzen""  playing wildly or ""razen""  rage/storm.		 @username Did you guys just change all your youtube video thumbnails or have I not paid proper attention lately?		 @username @username Do you also know about https://t.co/6SYVXc4GfN ?		 @username Is this april fools or did they really start a website on April 1st with the plan of confusing people on -every- anniversary?		 Whelp. @username wanted drama. He got drama. Can the devs get a nice game jam now  since that's what they wanted? #GAME_JAM		 Great april fools joke! Anita Sarkeesian receiving ""GDC Ambassador award"" for making 5 videos in two years' time. http://t.co/Wjl343UZLU		 @username For a moment I thought I was reading about a game from @username		 @username Your avvy is now black/red/white. Does this mean future content will be in Betrayer-vision?		 @username Hey I wanted to inform you that Potato Dungeon seems to be borked right now. Clicking to ride Pard doesn't work. For me anyways.		 Not fond of new @username design. Discrover shows less per page  and the menu bar shows less lines so I must scroll to get to my playlists.		 @username @username It's a carefully planned deal. He asked both for the exact same amount  so he's raking in cash but staying neutral.		 Combine any random music term in youtube  it probably has it. Raprock. Acapella metal. Industrial Jazz. Celtic chiptunes. Gregorian dubstep.		 @username I feel like I can 'express myself' less right now. It's all white. Will there be a way to change style besides just link color??		 @username @username Harold and Kumar walk Down the Aisle. Because racial inclusivity  of course. ;)		 Just crashed in to more bugs in 45 minutes on the bike  than in the past two weeks of game development.		 Goddamnit I hate it when a commenting system forces you to first register  but meanwhile doesn't save your typed post. @username #lookingatu		 @username is the new UI broken or just badly designed? I can no longer sort albums or search queries by name/artist/album/length/rating...		 @username @username Yes. But only cool people.

Good luck  best wishes  and dump that lump!		 Just rode past some kids biking ~25 km for some @username . I guess that's pretty healthy in the end?		 @username If you sit like this and stare past your crotch  it probably is. But only barely .http://t.co/rHhCiJSBcH		 @username Here's hoping this will wake people up a bit about greenlight / early access / kickstarter  right?		 @username What you're saying is  you're now opening a P.O. box under the name of CynicalCox?		 @username You hypocrite  you. Closing down your P.O. box for other companies but still accepting bribes from Polaris! Bias. BIAS!!		 Yay mustasch! http://t.co/D0ZqTeL8z7		 @username @username Jim is  in fact  a Drag King. In real life he is an ethereal spirit  but for his shows he dresses up as a man.		 @username The point is not better because 'harder' but 'balanced against lame exploits'; it means you actually think/engage with the game.		 This should be enough energydrink for at LEAST two days... http://t.co/vQVmlkjcot		 Bad pixel shirts are one of those things that annoy and bother me more than they probably should... http://t.co/b6fC4bNsUA		 @username So what do we call this kind of review score?

Ouch.		 @username @username Whoa whoa whoa. Not JUST a black baseball cap  one with a VERY iconic stitchy liny logo thing! http://t.co/sKMmh2gi4z		 @username @username Half-life? No  no. Carmack made Doom  Quake  Rage. Half-life is from @username.		 @username @username WHY? IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM? ARE THE ADS TOO SILENT TO HEAR FOR YOU? WE ARE NOT HAVING THAT ISSUE.		 Going to try and get something done for #lowrezjam 2014. 5 days left so it's gonna be tight. But I know what I'm gonna make: a 16x9 fighter.		 @username I'm not seeing the problem with that #lowrezjam workfile. Looks perfectly usable. http://t.co/Pv9PpWSKRw		 @username As long as everything is in nice sprite strips I'm happy. For small stuff like this panning around is easier than tabs/windows.		 @username Face pulp  actually. I should probably have scaled up the image 200% =P. Heck I'm working small enough to make the game 200%		 @username @username I'd like to know which devs you consider upstanding/trustworthy what with Nintendo greed  Watchdog graphics and 1/2		 @username @username indies such as Towns and that recent plane game (air control?).

Host as much content as possible  have curated lists of 'the best'  'the new' 1/2		 @username 'the interesting' and so on. Make it easier to navigate  empowering critics/users. Not curation  but promotion/navigation. (2/2)		 @username Wow  this was great. I love simple games like these that require very little time/complexity to convey a strong idea.		 @username Oh no! http://t.co/WEENVxgVcv is offline  as are the forums. Sound the alarms!

What I've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work.		 @username Yeah I know they're 2x. I scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. Does ingame have normals or something?		 @username I just finished my last game for the day  this should be a nice way to unwind.		 @username @username It really depends on the quality of the stuff  much like chocolate. Often I find they add too much powder  too.		 I... Uh... what? Dafuq? https://t.co/VT0eMJofYN		 @username Don't worry. You will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals. http://t.co/c8qaZNjW3L		 @username How are the podcasts rubbish? Only thing edited for (the YT version of) that are the commercials  right?		 @username I get the removal of streamed 'regular' music  I do. But background music from games? And beyond that  do you think that (1/2)		 @username it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=Â©  too) You generally say that streaming is a transformative art.		 @username Technically  this is a mobile game. And I'm not sure I would call this 'playing'.		 Yup  salticidae are definitely the bestest  coolest and most awesomest spiders.  https://t.co/Wr1elzCRf4		 @username No. You'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables  when such a simple command is all you need.		 @username Ooh. Sanchez. I strongly approve of this.		 @username @username @username I'm in that camp. Everyone* has a smartphone now  which makes it a true -personal- computer.		 @username @username The biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. Sports thrive on spectators. (semi)Finals get more views.		 @username @username Says it right there ""? The Jester Race A song by In Flames""		 @username @username Given that you regularly do long takes  though  this one felt ""slighly off"". (j/k well done Zooc)		 @username Lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy.		 @username I think you're mixing up Gone Home and Dear Esther. Not many people argued Gone Home wasn't a game  just not a GOOD one.		 @username I think you should do a combination. Good projects deserve love  but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned.		 @username It might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? Nope  nope  nope  this looks decent.		 @username @username @username Hurrah! You didn't call it the A/S/L challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name.		 @username @username Heck  look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box...		 @username AND DOLLA DOLLA BILLS YO. (also my shirt)		 @username @username http://t.co/LrtfFdiNqJ seems kind of relevant in this case too. From several perspectives.		 @username You're right on the first account. Many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of  debates is divisive. http://t.co/E4kkt588dH		 @username What's the crest for that?		 @username That actually seems interesting data  yeah. I wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that.		 Using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. Sorry mr snail...		 @username Liking youtubers isn't a problem either. Which leaves ""harassing"" as the only issue.		 @username Threat? Or... treat?		 Simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. Good on you  Germany. http://t.co/W62Wy4yIyr		 @username I know  right. You're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time.		 @username For me  personally  it's like a TV show. I can relax to it because it's more passive than articles  yet is not supershort.		 @username @username Quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.Wonder where this will go?		 @username @username You mean ""asshole"" culture  within the gaming and internet audience  right? I'm pretty sure that's what you mean.		 @username @username @username Should the flooding work that way? Don't you need 2 holes; one for water in  one for air out?		 @username Dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness.		 @username Jim  try Monster Rehab. It's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... I mean sweeteners.		 @username @username Unless your licence gets voided  in which case you pay â‚¬35 AND â‚¬70. Personally  I just wait for price drops.		 @username @username And what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play?		 @username @username It was a hypothetical. Hence why he says ""at your own risk"". It might work fine  it might cost you.		 @username Definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. A game has max 20 minutes  if it impresses you sooner  good on it.		 @username @username Ooh  this is pretty. Any info on how it's done? Looks like uprezzed render  sure  but any special texture approach?		 @username What  you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? Is this some kind of magic? Are you a wizerds?		 @username @username It is rather uncanny... http://t.co/EzJMUWrtS0		 Just binge-read the entirety of @username's comic. It's gooood. http://t.co/jVOCCOc5fp		 @username @username With 300+ employees  they're well past the 'Dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage.		 Didn't know I  a European  could send emails about net neutrality to US Gov. EUROPEANS UNITE! http://t.co/iJssKlF3rJ http://t.co/11MWt6BLo7		 @username I've always likened Dear Esther to a book or movie. You can press play/pause  but you don't really have any agency.		 @username Personally  I'd love physical media as an option  if it were JUST that. But most games nowadays are just a DVD + steam code.		 @username Next bundle? http://t.co/OJ7iOFedwb		 @username you have your own NPC and you're giving out games? CONSPIRACYYY!!!!		 @username @username @username He's an author at Destructoid. He IS games media.  Conrad  thanks for making the distinction.		",202,M,0,0,0,0,0

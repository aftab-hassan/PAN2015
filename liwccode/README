levNO-synYES-alllang.R is the program which generates LIWC for the test data
The program assumes that the test data's csv file is named as stage2Dutch.csv, stage2Italian.csv, stage2Spanish.csv, dataExtr1.csv
Run this proggram first using Rscript levNO-synYES-alllang.R, it will generate a file called test.csv which basically conntains the LIWC for the test data

Now run java -jar myjar.jar which will generate arff files and do prediction, it will create an output file called results

Then we have to run generatefinalxml.R which converts the results into an xml format, but I haven't completed this, won't take much time.

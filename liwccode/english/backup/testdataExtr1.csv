I've 15 years left for mine?		   your new discussion layout is confusing regarding who says what  because the comments aren't sectioned off.  		 I never really understood why game environments (which you see most of) get so few resources compared to characters.  		   20k and 2048Â² on a gun  fine. But throwing the same on an enemy that you try to shoot before he gets too close?		   Guns using the texture already in memory is good. Guns on the floor having the same model as FPS isn't. Probably LOD models.		   I'm talking about chars that are small scale compared to enviro props. Extreme example:   30~40tri scene		   Dammit Crendor. You broke Jesse's game and made the audio go *poof*. Totally your fault.		     I liken Esther to a movie. You can choose to progress or not  but not affect much else. But really  grey area.

Loving the smooth movement.		 So apparently paying â‚¬5 a month for Spotify makes me worse than a music pirate...? Dafuq?  		   Wanted to say I appreciate the choice for minions. Should make the game feel nicely crowded  and give 'bad' players more fun.		   Heh. I think it's funny you're apologizing for sound quality that's still better than  say  90% of youtube game voiceovers.		 I know this is cool and serious science  but it had me giggling like a kid. Best of both worlds!   		 Working on refining my logo... To chamfer or nor to chamfer  that is the question.  		 30c3 To Protect And Infect - YouTube   I don't know a whole lot about network security  but enough that this scares me.		 Silly Spotify. White Zombie  Judge Dredd (2012) Soundtrack  Rob Zombie  ...Blue Man Group? Okay then.		   Thanks for mentioning the Hearthstone open beta! I've been anxiously waiting but hadn't gotten any emails about it yet.		   Do you perchance read Jezebel? The timing is rather close:  		   I am so sick of people on twitter complaining about a bunch people on twitter!		 ""Helps to have a map!"" No. No it doesn't.  		   Remember the time you paid 10 grand for  ""Celebrity fashion without airbrushing"" pics? So do these people:  		 Steam's down. Wonder if that's because of the new music stuff?		 Play this. Now  tomorrow  during lunch  whenever. It's only 5 minutes  but it's awesome:  		 First time I bought a key for DOTA2 treasure chest: Baby Roshan. Pretty sweet deal.		 Hah! That shit's golden  Telltale!  		   Are you still looking for people? I can free up some time and be (almost) completely dedicated the next month(s).		   I threw up some isometric examples at   (assuming you want to stick with the RPGmaker perspective)		   Not many developers/companies would opt out of lots of money because something's addictive. I respect you for that.		 Now that's a proper free to play Dungeon Keeper!		   I like this.		      How do they not help? I find it very useful to know if a game has been designed for touchscreen  controller or KBM.		   Remember that fake Twitch-LoL video from this afternoon? Here's a REAL Twitch-Plays-Dota channel:  		   Thanks for reminding me/us to disable adblock for places I regularly visit. Because it's often a fairer trade that TV/radio.		 Mini Metro   Quite a novel idea: build your own growing metro system. Not sure about longevity/replayability  though.		   How about keeping the same root word and call them BullVids?		   Coil  because of its several experiments. Mirror's Edge  because of its absence. And whichever game started radial menus. Crysis?		   Consider that a free game thrown in by the gods  for your generous purchases.		   ""Luft"" means air  not red. And ""rauser"" probably stems from the Dutch verb ""rouzen""  playing wildly or ""razen""  rage/storm.		   Did you guys just change all your youtube video thumbnails or have I not paid proper attention lately?		     Do you also know about   ?

Can the devs get a nice game jam now  since that's what they wanted?  		 Great april fools joke! Anita Sarkeesian receiving ""GDC Ambassador award"" for making 5 videos in two years' time.  		   For a moment I thought I was reading about a game from  		   Your avvy is now black/red/white. Does this mean future content will be in Betrayer-vision?		   Hey I wanted to inform you that Potato Dungeon seems to be borked right now. Clicking to ride Pard doesn't work. For me anyways.		 Not fond of new   design. Discrover shows less per page  and the menu bar shows less lines so I must scroll to get to my playlists.		     It's a carefully planned deal. He asked both for the exact same amount  so he's raking in cash but staying neutral.		 Combine any random music term in youtube  it probably has it. Raprock. Acapella metal. Industrial Jazz. Celtic chiptunes. Gregorian dubstep.		   I feel like I can 'express myself' less right now. It's all white. Will there be a way to change style besides just link color??		     Harold and Kumar walk Down the Aisle. Because racial inclusivity  of course. ;)		 Just crashed in to more bugs in 45 minutes on the bike  than in the past two weeks of game development.		 Goddamnit I hate it when a commenting system forces you to first register  but meanwhile doesn't save your typed post.    		   is the new UI broken or just badly designed? I can no longer sort albums or search queries by name/artist/album/length/rating...		     Yes. But only cool people.		 Might be cool for portfolios:  : Horizontal scrolling single page template (also on Github):      		   I wonder how many people realized what horrible things they sometimes say. Good luck  best wishes  and dump that lump!		 Just rode past some kids biking ~25 km for some   . I guess that's pretty healthy in the end?		   If you sit like this and stare past your crotch  it probably is. But only barely . 		   Here's hoping this will wake people up a bit about greenlight / early access / kickstarter  right?		   What you're saying is  you're now opening a P.O. box under the name of CynicalCox?		   You hypocrite  you. Closing down your P.O. box for other companies but still accepting bribes from Polaris! Bias. BIAS!!		 Yay mustasch!  		     Jim is  in fact  a Drag King. In real life he is an ethereal spirit  but for his shows he dresses up as a man.		   The point is not better because 'harder' but 'balanced against lame exploits'; it means you actually think/engage with the game.		 This should be enough energydrink for at LEAST two days...  		 Bad pixel shirts are one of those things that annoy and bother me more than they probably should...  		   So what do we call this kind of review score? Hate.strife out of ten?		       Good Old Gaming  a store kinda like Steam  Origin  but aimed at retro/indie more than AAA.		   U.S. healthcare; it'll cost you an arm and a leg either way...		   Get the spambots under control  please.        		   and here's yet another one:  		   More spammers. Clean them up.    		   No  but I can reccommend you a great shirt:  		 Turns out  you should not attempt to run 4 km barefoot when you haven't done so in three years. Ouch.		     Whoa whoa whoa. Not JUST a black baseball cap  one with a VERY iconic stitchy liny logo thing!  		     Half-life? No  no. Carmack made Doom  Quake  Rage. Half-life is from  .		     WHY?

But I know what I'm gonna make: a 16x9 fighter.		   I'm not seeing the problem with that   workfile. Looks perfectly usable.  		   As long as everything is in nice sprite strips I'm happy. For small stuff like this panning around is easier than tabs/windows.		   Face pulp  actually. I should probably have scaled up the image 200% =P. Heck I'm working small enough to make the game 200%		     I'd like to know which devs you consider upstanding/trustworthy what with Nintendo greed  Watchdog graphics and 1/2		     indies such as Towns and that recent plane game (air control?).

Lots of women feature their looks.    		 The times when your dog wants to eat the rotting half-corpse of a mouse and you have to pluck it out of her mouth...

I'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability.		   Will this work with the regular PC forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? Would be handy to have that integrated.		   Gotta be honest here  these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. A downside of 3d  or maybe a render/filter issue?		   Can hardly wait for PC version X. What I've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work.		   Yeah I know they're 2x. I scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. Does ingame have normals or something?		   I just finished my last game for the day  this should be a nice way to unwind.		     It really depends on the quality of the stuff  much like chocolate. Often I find they add too much powder  too.		 I... Uh... what? Dafuq?  		   Don't worry. You will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals.  		   How are the podcasts rubbish? Only thing edited for (the YT version of) that are the commercials  right?		   I get the removal of streamed 'regular' music  I do. But background music from games? And beyond that  do you think that (1/2)		   it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=Â©  too) You generally say that streaming is a transformative art.		   Technically  this is a mobile game. And I'm not sure I would call this 'playing'.		 Yup  salticidae are definitely the bestest  coolest and most awesomest spiders.   		   No. You'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables  when such a simple command is all you need.		   Ooh. Sanchez. I strongly approve of this.		       I'm in that camp. Everyone* has a smartphone now  which makes it a true -personal- computer.		     The biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. Sports thrive on spectators. (semi)Finals get more views.		     Says it right there ""? The Jester Race A song by In Flames""		     Given that you regularly do long takes  though  this one felt ""slighly off"". (j/k well done Zooc)		   Lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy.		   I think you're mixing up Gone Home and Dear Esther. Not many people argued Gone Home wasn't a game  just not a GOOD one.		   I think you should do a combination. Good projects deserve love  but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned.		   It might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? Nope  nope  nope  this looks decent.		       Hurrah! You didn't call it the A/S/L challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name.		     Heck  look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box...		   AND DOLLA DOLLA BILLS YO. (also my shirt)		       seems kind of relevant in this case too. From several perspectives.		   You're right on the first account. Many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of  debates is divisive.  		   What's the crest for that?		   That actually seems interesting data  yeah. I wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that.		 Using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. Sorry mr snail...		   Liking youtubers isn't a problem either. Which leaves ""harassing"" as the only issue.		   Threat? Or... treat?		 Simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. Good on you  Germany.  		   I know  right. You're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time.		   For me  personally  it's like a TV show. I can relax to it because it's more passive than articles  yet is not supershort.		     Quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.Wonder where this will go?		     You mean ""asshole"" culture  within the gaming and internet audience  right? I'm pretty sure that's what you mean.		       Should the flooding work that way? Don't you need 2 holes; one for water in  one for air out?		   Dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness.		   Jim  try Monster Rehab. It's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... I mean sweeteners.		     Unless your licence gets voided  in which case you pay â‚¬35 AND â‚¬70. Personally  I just wait for price drops.		     And what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play?		     It was a hypothetical. Hence why he says ""at your own risk"". It might work fine  it might cost you.		   Definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. A game has max 20 minutes  if it impresses you sooner  good on it.		     Ooh  this is pretty. Any info on how it's done? Looks like uprezzed render  sure  but any special texture approach?		   What  you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? Is this some kind of magic? Are you a wizerds?		     It is rather uncanny...  		 Just binge-read the entirety of  's comic. It's gooood.  		     With 300+ employees  they're well past the 'Dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage.		 Didn't know I  a European  could send emails about net neutrality to US Gov. EUROPEANS UNITE!    		   I've always likened Dear Esther to a book or movie. You can press play/pause  but you don't really have any agency.		   Personally  I'd love physical media as an option  if it were JUST that. But most games nowadays are just a DVD + steam code.		   Next bundle?  		   you have your own NPC and you're giving out games? CONSPIRACYYY!!!!		       He's an author at Destructoid. He IS games media.  Conrad  thanks for making the distinction.
